                <b>HEY THERE &#x1F44B;</b>
 My name is <em>Hope</em> ,and i am so glad you are here.This portfolio is a reflection of my journey - a space where curiosity meets creativity
and learning turns into growth. With a background in Human physiology,Psychology and Genetics ,I have always been facinated by the way things work.
Both in people and in the world around us ,now as I embrace the world of tech,I am choosing to challange my self, evolve, and create meaningful solutions.
Every project you see here is a testament to the choices i have made to grow, improve and push beyond my comfort zone.My hope is that it inspires you to do the same.
