    A Little background about me
</h2 class="deco">
<p class="group">
    I grew up in Soshanguve, a township in Pretoria, and I’ve always been passionate about growth and learning. I graduated twice from the University of Pretoria, earning a BSc in Human Physiology, Psychology, and Genetics. While my academic background is rooted in science, my curiosity led me to the world of tech, where I discovered endless opportunities for problem-solving and innovation.



    I’m currently enrolled in the Power Learn Project (PLP) bootcamp, sharpening my skills to become a data analyst. Along the way, I’ve earned certifications through SoloLearn and have been diving into Python, HTML, and CSS—exploring ways to integrate them effectively. What excites me most about tech is its potential for growth and the fact that there’s always something new to learn.
    
    
    
    When I’m not coding or upskilling, you can find me in the kitchen trying out new recipes or staying active through exercise.
